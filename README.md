1. Open ImageJ
2. Drag the Segmenation.ijm to the ImageJ window
3. Click "run" located at the top of the window tap
4. Locate where the images are. The folder hirarche is following Vala convention:
e.g.
experiment1---scan---Well_A_001
                          |
                          |-------fluo-4
                          |
                          |-------nuclei
                          |
                          |-------_VoltageMonitor
                          |
                          |------- Results.txt
                          |
                          |------- WellScanInfo_xxxxxx.xml
                          |
                          |------- Output (Generated by the program after processing all the images)
You should locate the image path as experiment1/scan/Well_A_001.
The program will look for the images in fluo-4
Note that: The program will obtain a mean image over all the frame of images, then use it and the nuclei image to perform segmentation.
5. There will be a 2 txt file, Output.txt and Results.txt, when the process is completed.
Output.txt is the extracted intensity for all time frame images. The data is oriented as one cell data per column.
Results.txt is segmentation results, listing the area of the cell and the area ratio of cell nucleus to whole cell.
6. You should use Excel to open the Output.txt and save it as .xlsx, before proceeding to extract physiological data.
